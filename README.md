# Karros: Answers to SICP
## What is this repo?
This repo represents the work I'm doing for the famous CS textbook, "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" by Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, and Julie Sussman. Heralded by the CS community as the best book on programming, my curiousity got the best of me and now I'm trying it out for myself.
