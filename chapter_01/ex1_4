; Observer that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose 
; operators are compound expressions. Use this observation to describe 
; the behavior of the follow procedure

(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))

; Answer:
; if b is greater than 0, add a and b
; else, subtract b from a
; since b is negative, it'll add itself to a!
; so be will always add.
